2012: Marvel's The Avengers (2012) 
Rated PG-13 – 2h 23m – Director: Joss Whedon – IMDb- 8.0/10 

* In a stranger moment of improvisation, Downey Jr. also hid food all over the lab set. So when he offers Captain America a blueberry in one tense scene and when he's eating, it wasn't in the script, Downey Jr. was simply hungry. 

* The process of creating Hulk’s voice involved taking a combination of "Mark Ruffalo, some Lou Ferrigno, and a little bit of me and two people from New Zealand." 

* Whedon initially planned to put Shang-Chi in this Phase 1 team-up concluder. But those plans were scrapped. 

* Chris Evans had a prosthetic beard cover during the shawarma post-credits scene because Evans shot Snowpiercer when this final scene was stitched into the movie.

* In some of Stark's scenes with Pepper Potts, Gwyneth Paltrow walks around barefoot as a quirk of her character. But in actual fact, it was because Downey Jr is just 5'8" and Paltrow is 5'9".
